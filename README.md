ASP.NET Core API architecture starter project - All-in-One

THIS PROJECT IS CURRENTLY EMPTY, because I am currently working on individual components below first. Once I have a few components ready, I will bring them into this all-in-one project. Please watch this in order to get notification when I publish updates to this project.

This is a template project aimed to showcase the following components. 

- Serilog for logging
- In-memory cache through Dependency Injection
- Swagger and OData
- Azure Blob Storage service through Dependency Injection
- Entity Framework Core and SQL Server
- Email service through Dependency Injection
- AutoMapper through Dependency Injection
- User service using ASP.NET Core Identity and JWT token
- Strongly typed appsettings using IOptions
- Message Broker service (Azure Service Bus or RabbitMQ) through Dependency Injection
- Distributed Cache
- etc.
