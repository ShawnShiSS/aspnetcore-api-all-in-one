ASP.NET Core API starter project - All-in-One

This project is a simple starter project for building a REST API using ASP.NET Core. Compared to a fully implemented Clean Architecture, this project contains everything it needs in the same project to get started quickly without the overhead and learning curve of the Clean Architecture.

THIS PROJECT IS WORK IN PROGRESS.
